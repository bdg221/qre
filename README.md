# A Survery of Quantum Resource Estimation Tools
This repository contains the code and results referenced in paper.

Azure_QRE_Shor.pdf - This file contains a PDF of the results of running Azure QRE on the ShorRE.qs file from the qsharp GitHub repository (https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/main/samples/estimation/ShorRE.qs). The results were generated using qubit_gate_ns_e3, qubit_gate_ns_e4, qubit_maj_ns_e4 + floquet_code, and qubit_maj_ns_e6 + floquet code. An error budget of 0.333 was assigned since the results of running Shor's algorithm can be verified easily.
